# MailmanSpamHelper

An extension for Google Chrome that saves a few clicks when moderating the daily dose of spam mails:
  * The extension automatically selects the "Discard" option for every mail that is held for moderation. As a result, the moderator has to manually accept all relevant messages instead of manually discarding all spam mails. Usually, this leads to an enormous reduction of necessary clicks.
  * Furthermore, the extension selects the "Add **** to one of these sender filters:" options. Do not forget to deselect this option if required.

## Supported languages
   * english
   * german
